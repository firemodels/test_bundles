# CFAST, FDS and Smokeview test bundles
The [releases](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases)
in this repo contain test bundles and manuals for the programs
[cfast](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/CFAST_TEST),
[fds](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/FDS_TEST), and
[smokeview](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/SMOKEVIEW_TEST).
These programs are tested daily by the scripts cfastbot, firebot and smokebot found in the 
[bot repo](https://github.com/firemodels/bot). 
If the tests pass then bundles are built
using the same repo hash as used when running the tests.
These hashes are found in the same release location as the bundles in the files CFAST_HASH, FDS_HASH and SMOKEVIEW_HASH.
These hashes are also found in the release title along with the date and time when the commit was made.
