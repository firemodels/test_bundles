# CFAST, FDS and Smokeview test bundles
This repo contains test bundles and manuals for
[fds](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/FDS_TEST),
[smokeview](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/SMOKEVIEW_TEST), and
[cfast](https://github.com/firemodels/test_bundles/releases/tag/CFAST_TEST).
The scripts firebot, smokebot and cfastbot run daily testing these programs.
If the tests pass then test bundles are built
with the repo revision used by the bots.
